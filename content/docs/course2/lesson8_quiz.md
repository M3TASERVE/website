- Describe a contract (on-chain and off-chain interactions)
- Find technical, logic and hack issues in a contract
- How to do a proxy contract without its own impl ?

- Develop a Smart Contract that statisfies the following specifications:
 * We want to build a fundraising DApp that enables creators to publish their project proposal in order to raise money in the form of ERC20 Token. A Campaign is limited in time and a minimal funding must be reached within its duration to unlock the funds. If the goal is not reached, the contributers must be refunded.
 * A Campaign has multiple stages:
   * launching : only registered users can create a campaign. A new campaign must define it start / end dates and its funding goals. Only a valid campaign that has an end date greater than the start date and a positive goal can be created.
   * running : during the campaign duration, registered users can participate. Only the creator can cancel the campaign at any time. Participants cannot cancel their participations.

The Smart Contract must implement the following interface:
